    <h1 style="font-size:xx-large">What we are all about</h1>
    <p>Our start up company provides clear insight into information technology. What does this mean you might ask? Absolutely nothing. This is what makes our company so special. What we do here is take your money and completely spend it on whatever we want. However we know you will still end up supporting us.  </p>
    <p>Our designers want to create a platform where people can also express the narcissitic and unconsiderate tendacies. We aim to create a halo of toxicity in our community. </p> <br>
    <p style="border: 1px solid black"> Our fine engineers have worked tireless to provide our customers with absolutely nothing. <br> <br> Our company grows with the help of crowd funding, with your money we are able to provide people with nothing.</p>
