    <p style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">If I were still alive I wouldn't invest in StressHub - Steve Jobs 2022</p>
    <p style="border: solid black 2px; font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Steve Jobs inspired our company for what it is today. He is the soul reason this company even started. We weren't however inspired by his exaulting intellegence but rather his scheer will to walk over everyone he knew. Just like how we want to be with our company.</p>

  <h1>Origins of our company</h1>
  <p>Our company was founded my the magnifacent Kai Knoch</p>
  <p>His goal was to imagine a world where everyone can just give him money without having to do any work</p>
  <p>That's when he thought of the company Stress Hub, a place where people could be stupid enough to give him money through the idea of crowd funding.</p>
